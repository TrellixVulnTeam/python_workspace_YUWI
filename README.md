Lots of practice questions from leetcode, algoexpert, hackerrank.. over 200 by now. Most are optimized for time, while others are using less space, a few could be updated and made more efficient. Overall just a depository for general practicing.

A few mini projects are also thrown in there. This is by far my largest code repository. Hope you find something useful in there.
